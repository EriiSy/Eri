# About Me

🟡 Good Morning, or "Bom Dia", I'm Eri.

📚 I'm a Computer Science student.

📝 I'm very interested in programming and eager to learn more and more. My curiosity drives me to explore various programming languages like Python, Java, and C/C++. But, one step at a time; everything in its own time. My goal is to learn step by step.

🏠 I hope you feel at home here, just as I do.

⚙️ I am currently learning structured language. My opinion? It's incredible. Thinking about how naturally brilliant minds made this all work is fascinating.
